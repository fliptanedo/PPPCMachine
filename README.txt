These are Mathematica files to accompany 
"On-Shell Mediators and Top--Charm Dark Matter Models for the FERMI Galactic Center Excess"
Rajaraman, Smolinsky, Tanedo
arXiv:1503.xxxxx

The main file is PPPCMachine.nb
See the header text for information.
The other files organize batch runs to generate spectra for on-shell mediators.

PPPCPlotter_01.nb takes the results and makes pretty plots.
If you only care about how to make pretty plots in Mathematica, you can look at that file.

If you use any of them, please, please, please cite that work.
It's good karma. It also incentivizes open science.

As always, please feel free to submit errors/suggestions either directly or through GitHub.

Thanks,
